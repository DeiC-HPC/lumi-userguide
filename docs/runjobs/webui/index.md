Choose the correct authentication provider which for most LUMI users is "MyAccessID" (users with a Finnish allocation can also use "CSC" or "HAKA"), and follow the authentication procedure.

After successful authentication, you will see the dashboard.

From here you can browse your files on the supercomputer, start a shell, view running jobs or start one of the many available applications. The dashboard also contains some important system information.
