The Desktop app allows running various graphical applications on the LUMI compute nodes.

When launched on the LUMI-D partition, GPU acceleration is available.
On other partitions, CPU rendering is used, which can be slow in some applications.
For both the GPU accelerated Desktop and the normal Desktop, you will find basic tools for viewing images, videos, editing text and managing files.

Currently, the following graphical applications are available with GPU acceleration:

- Blender
- ParaView

You can find the available applications in the apps dropdown in the taskbar, under the *Other* category.
If you want to be able to access the apps easier, shortcuts to the applications can be created by dragging the icons to the desktop.
